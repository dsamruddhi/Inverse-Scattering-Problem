# Inverse-Scattering-Problem

This repository contains simulation code for the inverse scattering problem in the context of indoor imaging using Wi-Fi waves. The goal of the inverse scattering problem as useful in indoor imaging is to reconstruct the location, shape and refractive index of an object kept in an indoor region using wireless signals.

### Generating random objects / scatterers

### Solving the forward problem

### Solving the inverse problem
